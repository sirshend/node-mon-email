##### 1. Keep assist.sh, commd.txt, and email-script.py files in the same directory
##### 2. In the commd.txt, in --data-raw, change the email-ID to whatever email you wish to receive the notification
##### 3. Then run using  ```python3 email-script.py'''
##### 4. The contents sent in the email body is simple now, just shows if each node is active, and the unreachable node(s) if any, but more data can be included in the emails pretty quickly
